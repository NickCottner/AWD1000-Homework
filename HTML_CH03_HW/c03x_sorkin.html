		<h2>Movie reviews</h2>
	
	<blockquote>
		<q> Lot's of heat but not very much light. It came across as a kind of 
	daytime soap opera version showing the personalities of <br>the players rather than dealing with 
	the nuts and bolts of what really happened. 
	Even that would not have been so bad but <br>the movie tries to portray 
	lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the right thing.</q>
	</blockquote> 
	
	<blockquote> 
		<q> I am watching this for the 3rd time, trying to understand how 
	this large group of capitalist pigs could royally screw their <br>families, descendants, neighbors, 
	countrymen and the rest of the whole world with absolutely no compassion.</q>
